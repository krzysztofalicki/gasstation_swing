multithreading graphic window app made in java swing

it is the simulation of gas station working
blue squares are cars and magenta ones are workers
each square is different thread

cars waiting for empty space inside the station
when finally it is possible to go in they have to wait
before the small entrance - only for one car

then they go in
and go to empty slot
waiting for worker
after that they can go out
and them different car can go in

that's how it works

I used here threads, lock elements, synchronized methods,
synchronized code blocks, wait and notify methods
and some different features
